Currently, at **CASSA**, we aim to detect and map the redshifted **21-cm signal** emitted by **neutral hydrogen (HI) from the early universe**, particularly during the dark ages and cosmic dawn. This faint cosmological signal offers a powerful probe into the **formation of the first stars, galaxies, and large-scale structure**. However, its detection is **extremely challenging** due to **overwhelming foreground emissions, instrumental systematics, and ionospheric distortions**. 

Project **CHronOS** addresses these challenges through a combination of **theoretical modeling, high-fidelity simulations, and observational strategies** using **low-frequency radio arrays**.

THis is where project **PrimaBERA** comes into picture. To model low frequency arrays, we need to first model the primary beam of such low frequency antennas such as LOFAR and SKA.
